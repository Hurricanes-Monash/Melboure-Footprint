But this scene of innocence was created in a far less naive setting.\nStanford was apprenticed to a London stonemason before coming to Australia to try his luck on the Bendigo goldfields. When he failed to make his fortune, he turned to horse stealing, and in 1854 was imprisoned for 10 years. He was released after six on ticket-of-leave, but was soon found guilty on two charges of highway robbery and another of horse stealing. The sentences amounted to a total of 22 years, two of which were served as hard labour in irons after Stanford broke out of a supposedly 'escape-proof' gaol in 1861. In Melbourne's Pentridge Prison, Stanford's talent for drawing and carving was recognised - he carved bones left over from stews - and the prison governor allowed him to turn his hand to carving stone. Local sculptor Charles Summers tutored Stanford, who soon set to carving a fountain from bluestone from the prison quarry, which was the only material available to him. He modelled the fountain's avian adornments on a stuffed eagle-hawk and modelled the boy on the governor's son.\nThe fountain was installed in Carpentaria Place (now known as Gordon Reserve) in 1871, following Stanford's release after he - and his friends petitioned for this on the grounds of his ill health. The Illustrated Australian News claimed the fountain was 'not only a work of great beauty but...executed under circumstances of extreme difficulty [which for] most men would have been insurmountable'.

He was a controversial man, who commanded much respect for his actions on the battlefield and his willingness to challenge British and US generals, but his skills did not translate well to the civilian arena. As police commissioner of Victoria between 1925 and 1936, he was harsh in his treatment of Labor activists and the unemployed, and he resigned amid scandal when he was linked to wounding the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Bureau. Still, Blamey was knighted in 1935 and promoted to field marshal in 1950, the year before he died.\nA memorial to Blamey was announced in 1958, although its site opposite the memorial to Sir John Monash had been reserved since 1952. There was some dispute over just what vehicle Blamey would be mounted on, with both tradition and Blamey's wife demanding a horse. Ewers won this battle and mounted his subject on a military Jeep. Sited opposite Monash on his stead - with whom Blamey had served in World War I - Ewers' statue captures the transformation of the technologies of war through this symbol of its mechanisation. In familiar military practice, the plaque is a roll call of Blamey's military positions.\nEwers' sculpture is one of the few pieces of traditional memorial statuary created after the 1950s.

It has been conceived to engage with its environment, visually connecting to its surroundings through both form and material.\nSpronk's intention was to create a dialogue of sorts between art, history and place. His inspiration was Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem 'Ozymandias', which speaks of the fragile and transient nature of all that is human. Quoting from the poem, the pedestal reads: 'My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings. Look on my work you Mighty, and despair.'

It was constructed for the first of Melbourne's two grand international world fairs. The fountain's visual elements were designed to display the young colony's confidence and advancement, simultaneously signalling the purpose of world fairs to display the produce and industry of nations. At the central level of the fountain, four youths (representing a young and vibrant colony) dance below symbols of the arts, science, commerce and industry; for example, musical instruments, a telescope, sailing ship, steam engine and globe of the world. Above this are images of Victoria's indigenous flora and fauna, and a boy with a clamshell. Holding all of this aloft are four merpeople rising up from the waters of the lower pool. Built during Victoria's boom years, the fountain's spouting water, it was thought, would demonstrate the power and success of the recently established Yan Yean project, which brought potable water to the city.

A replica of this statue was cast in London for the City of Melbourne, and was erected in 1904 under the auspices of the Caledonian Society. Lawson's Burns is an imposing, larger than life-size figure depicted in tails and breeches, his posture and countenance suggesting a powerful spirit. Lawson's sculpture of Burns cost around £1000, and it is said that nearly every Scot in Melbourne contributed. The memorial symbolises the contribution Scottish migrants made to the early development of Victoria, with many of the first graziers and squatters in Gippsland and the Western District being of Scottish descent. The memorial remains a uniting symbol for Melbourne's Scottish community. It was originally located on the west side of St Kilda Road, where Sir John Madden, the lieutenant governor, unveiled it on 23 January 1904.

Natural falls in the river created a barrier between the salt- and freshwater, and just below the falls a natural widening in the river enabled boats to turn around after unloading at Customs House (now the Immigration Museum).\n In 1996, the Yarra Turning Basin Project was launched. This would recreate the historic turning basin, which had since been filled in, and develop a new riverside promenade that would complement and extend the existing spatial design of the river's northern bank. The concept for the site's public artwork entailed a series of five figureheads, which would sit on wooden piers that were integral to the design and material of the timber wharf.\n Council's Public Art & Acquisitions Committee selected Bruce Armstrong and Geoffrey Bartlett's design from a short-list of four. Both Armstrong and Bartlett are renowned Melbourne sculptors, each having undertaken many public commissions and having exhibited widely. With the working title '5 figureheads', they crafted Constellation from wood and metal, and using traditional and contemporary approaches to the sculpture's design. The five carved-wood figureheads comprise a dragon, woman, bird, man and lion. These evoke a long history of figurehead carving from around the world and also reflect the ethnic and cultural diversity of those who used the turning basin during the early years of settlement. The constructed metal elements suggest maritime forms, lines and images but they are never simply literal; they require the viewer to engage with the work to read their reference point. The title of this work, too, pays homage to the long history of seafaring, the stars having guided many a vessel from one port to another.\n Constellation was unveiled in 1997."  ],

In the early 1900s, she studied sculpture with Edouard Lanteri at the Royal College of Art, London. On her return to Australia, she quickly became the country's most acclaimed woman sculptor, undertaking a number of important commissions.\n One such piece is her marble bust of the English nurse Edith Cavell. This work commemorates a woman whose beneficence delivered her a tragic end, which is depicted on the cast-bronze relief panels on the bust's pedestal.\n Edith Cavell trained as nurse in the late 1890s. In 1907, she was posted in Brussels to assist in establishing a modern nursing system at the Berkendael Medical Institute. At the outbreak of World War I she was left in charge of the hospital and what is now known as the Red Cross. During that time she assisted more than 200 Belgian, British and French soldiers who had been separated from their armies, or who had escaped German detention. In 1915, she was accused of conspiring to help prisoners escape, and was tried by a military court in Brussels. She was convicted and sentenced to death, along with four others. Cavell was executed by firing squad on 12 October 1915; she was still wearing her nurse's uniform. Her last words feature on one of the memorial's plaques: 'I know now that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred and no bitterness towards anyone.' Cavell's body was returned to England in 1919, where a full military service was conducted at Westminster Abbey.\n The appeal for funds for a Cavell memorial garnered such support in Australia that much of the money was devoted to assisting incapacitated war nurses. In 1916, the Edith Cavell Trust Fund was officially inaugurated in Victoria; it lasted nearly 60 years, until 1974."  ],

The lions were thought to have mythic power and were stationed at temple doors to protect the dharma. \nIn China they were traditionally placed at the gates to imperial palaces and tombs, temples and government offices to ward off evil and misfortune, but over the centuries they've shifted into the more popular realm, now even featuring ouside supermarkets. \nThey most commonly appear in pairs, the male lion playing with a ball (representing the world) and positioned to the right of the doorway, and the female, depicted with a cub (representing the family), positioned to the left."  ],

She completed a Master of Fine Arts at RMIT, where her research led her to explore repeated forms and the rhythms they create. These concerns are apparent in Island Wave, her first major public sculpture in Melbourne.\nIsland Wave is a large work that comprises a repeated motif and which follows the gentle curve of the Franklin and Queen Streets roundabout. Young's motif is a French curve, to which she was drawn for its sensuality and its past use as a mechanical drawing aid for the technical works executed by engineers and architects. The repetition of this motif along the curve of the roundabout creates a sense of movement, particularly for the motorist travelling alongside it. It is scaled to give one the sensation of both moving in rhythm to and being engulfed by a wave. Unlike a solid monolithic sculpture, there is a certain 'lightness' about Island Wave, which is achieved by its thinness, its open form and the sense of movement it evokes. Island Wave engages both the motorist and pedestrian, and its prominent location near Queen Victoria Market ensures that it has a local and international audience.\nThis elegant sculpture was created as the inaugural work for the council's Melbourne Collection Commissions, a fund for significant and permanent site-specific works by contemporary artists. It was fabricated by Gilbro Engineering and installed by Famous Constructions. Controversially, the sculpture replaced Tom Bill's With and With Each Other, which, despite having only a three-month permit, had remained on the roundabout since the 1998 Construction in Process Sculpture Festival. Island Wave was launched by Lord Mayor John So and Councillor Kimberly Kitching in October 2003."  ],

Born to a wealthy family with political pedigree, he was the youngest man ever elected president, and he brought vibrancy to government that gave hope to many around the world. Kennedy was sworn in as president in January 1961, calling his campaign 'The New Frontier'. Besides averting a nuclear war with the Soviets over the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, his administration spearheaded many progressive causes. While riding in an open-top limousine through the streets of Dallas, Texas, Kennedy was shot and killed by Lee Harvey Oswald on 22 November 1963.\nMemorials to prominent British figures attest to Australia's links with Empire, but this is particularly significant for being a rare monument to an American.

His commissions include Melbourne's statue of Sir William Clarke and the medal for the London Olympics. He was knighted in 1921, and elected to the Royal Academy in 1922.\nMackennal's statue of Edward VII depicts a heroic king in the full dress uniform of a British field marshal. The eldest son of Queen Victoria, Edward was rebellious into his adulthood and the Queen showed her displeasure by denying him any governmental position. Despite his lack of experience, Edward successfully negotiated England's conciliation with France, earning him the title of 'the peacemaker', and his social reforms made him popular among his subjects.\nThe desire to create a monument to Edward in Melbourne took hold immediately following his death in 1910. Mackennal was commissioned to undertake the work on a tender of £1867, but the statue eventually cost three times that price. The outbreak of World War I delayed the statue's production, but casting in London commenced at the war's end. It was unveiled in 1920."  ],
