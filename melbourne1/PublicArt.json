Natural falls in the river created a barrier between the salt- and freshwater, and just below the falls a natural widening in the river enabled boats to turn around after unloading at Customs House (now the Immigration Museum).\n In 1996, the Yarra Turning Basin Project was launched. This would recreate the historic turning basin, which had since been filled in, and develop a new riverside promenade that would complement and extend the existing spatial design of the river's northern bank. The concept for the site's public artwork entailed a series of five figureheads, which would sit on wooden piers that were integral to the design and material of the timber wharf.\n Council's Public Art & Acquisitions Committee selected Bruce Armstrong and Geoffrey Bartlett's design from a short-list of four. Both Armstrong and Bartlett are renowned Melbourne sculptors, each having undertaken many public commissions and having exhibited widely. With the working title '5 figureheads', they crafted Constellation from wood and metal, and using traditional and contemporary approaches to the sculpture's design. The five carved-wood figureheads comprise a dragon, woman, bird, man and lion. These evoke a long history of figurehead carving from around the world and also reflect the ethnic and cultural diversity of those who used the turning basin during the early years of settlement. The constructed metal elements suggest maritime forms, lines and images but they are never simply literal; they require the viewer to engage with the work to read their reference point. The title of this work, too, pays homage to the long history of seafaring, the stars having guided many a vessel from one port to another.\n Constellation was unveiled in 1997.","Constellation","http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/33707753.jpg","Stainless steel, copper and Cyrpus-pine sculpture"  ],

It was constructed for the first of Melbourne's two grand international world fairs. The fountain's visual elements were designed to display the young colony's confidence and advancement, simultaneously signalling the purpose of world fairs to display the produce and industry of nations. At the central level of the fountain, four youths (representing a young and vibrant colony) dance below symbols of the arts, science, commerce and industry; for example, musical instruments, a telescope, sailing ship, steam engine and globe of the world. Above this are images of Victoria's indigenous flora and fauna, and a boy with a clamshell. Holding all of this aloft are four merpeople rising up from the waters of the lower pool. Built during Victoria's boom years, the fountain's spouting water, it was thought, would demonstrate the power and success of the recently established Yan Yean project, which brought potable water to the city.

William Miller predicted on the basis of Daniel  and the \"day-year principle\" that Jesus Christ would return to Earth between the spring of 1843 and the spring of 1844. In the summer of 1844, Millerites came to believe that Jesus would return on October 22, 1844, understood to be the biblical Day of Atonement for that year. When this did not happen (an event known as the \"Great Disappointment\"), most of his followers disbanded and returned to their original churches.  Some Millerites came to believe that Miller's calculations were correct but that his interpretation of Daniel 8:14 was flawed as he assumed it was the \"earth that was to be cleansed\" or Christ would come to cleanse the world. These Adventists arrived at the conviction that Daniel 8:14 foretold Christ's entrance into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary rather than his Second Coming. This new awareness of a sanctuary in heaven became an important part of their thinking. Over the next few decades this understanding developed into the doctrine of the investigative judgment, an eschatological process commenced in 1844 in which Christians will be judged to verify their eligibility for salvation and God's justice will be confirmed before the universe. This group of Adventists continued to believe that Christ's Second Coming would be imminent. They resisted setting further dates for the event, citing Revelation 10:6, \"that there should be time no longer.\"","Glen Huntly Seventh-Day Adventist Church","https://victoriancollections.net.au/media/collectors/4f729f7b97f83e03086018a9/items/5363016a9821f40c64c6ce94/5363016a9821f40c64c6ce95/VictorianCollections-large.jpg","Church"  ],

Manufactured by Garnkirk, its simple design comprises three tazza bowls of diminishing size set on a volcanic-rock outcrop within a pool.\nIts construction commenced in 1863 under the direction of Clement Hodgkinson, the assistant commissioner of the Survey Office. The original concept incorporated a pool 100 feet (30.5 metres) long, with a central cluster of rocks from which water was to be ejected to nearly 50 feet (15.25 metres), though this appears not to have been realised. The pond was filled with small islands of aquatic plantings and Sydney couch grass.\nIn 1968, Melbourne City Council wanted to replace the fountain with an elaborate sundial to commemorate the recently deceased Prime Minister Harold Holt. When the council's intention became known, some 800 people petitioned against the fountain's removal. In the face of such opposition, plans for the sundial were scrapped and the Grey Street Fountain retained.\nThe fountain is the only surviving ornament in its original position remaining in Fitzroy Gardens from that period.","Grey Street Fountain","http://www.fitzroygardens.com/Images/Grey_Fountain.jpg","Cement fountain"  ],

She completed a Master of Fine Arts at RMIT, where her research led her to explore repeated forms and the rhythms they create. These concerns are apparent in Island Wave, her first major public sculpture in Melbourne.\nIsland Wave is a large work that comprises a repeated motif and which follows the gentle curve of the Franklin and Queen Streets roundabout. Young's motif is a French curve, to which she was drawn for its sensuality and its past use as a mechanical drawing aid for the technical works executed by engineers and architects. The repetition of this motif along the curve of the roundabout creates a sense of movement, particularly for the motorist travelling alongside it. It is scaled to give one the sensation of both moving in rhythm to and being engulfed by a wave. Unlike a solid monolithic sculpture, there is a certain 'lightness' about Island Wave, which is achieved by its thinness, its open form and the sense of movement it evokes. Island Wave engages both the motorist and pedestrian, and its prominent location near Queen Victoria Market ensures that it has a local and international audience.\nThis elegant sculpture was created as the inaugural work for the council's Melbourne Collection Commissions, a fund for significant and permanent site-specific works by contemporary artists. It was fabricated by Gilbro Engineering and installed by Famous Constructions. Controversially, the sculpture replaced Tom Bill's With and With Each Other, which, despite having only a three-month permit, had remained on the roundabout since the 1998 Construction in Process Sculpture Festival.

In the early 1900s, she studied sculpture with Edouard Lanteri at the Royal College of Art, London. On her return to Australia, she quickly became the country's most acclaimed woman sculptor, undertaking a number of important commissions.\n One such piece is her marble bust of the English nurse Edith Cavell. This work commemorates a woman whose beneficence delivered her a tragic end, which is depicted on the cast-bronze relief panels on the bust's pedestal.\n Edith Cavell trained as nurse in the late 1890s. In 1907, she was posted in Brussels to assist in establishing a modern nursing system at the Berkendael Medical Institute. At the outbreak of World War I she was left in charge of the hospital and what is now known as the Red Cross. During that time she assisted more than 200 Belgian, British and French soldiers who had been separated from their armies, or who had escaped German detention. In 1915, she was accused of conspiring to help prisoners escape, and was tried by a military court in Brussels. She was convicted and sentenced to death, along with four others. Cavell was executed by firing squad on 12 October 1915; she was still wearing her nurse's uniform. Her last words feature on one of the memorial's plaques: 'I know now that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred and no bitterness towards anyone.' Cavell's body was returned to England in 1919, where a full military service was conducted at Westminster Abbey.\n The appeal for funds for a Cavell memorial garnered such support in Australia that much of the money was devoted to assisting incapacitated war nurses. In 1916, the Edith Cavell Trust Fund was officially inaugurated in Victoria; it lasted nearly 60 years, until 1974.","Nurse Edith Cavell","http://www.whitehat.com.au/images/People/Cavell.jpg","Marble bust with cast-bronze panels on granite pedestal"  ],

Early colonists could sight incoming ships from this high point, which brought tangible links with the old country; and known as Burial Hill, it was also the city's first burial ground. This latter role is reflected well in the Gothic architecture of the memorial, for as if wrested from an English church it is a reminder that this final resting place for an estimated six early settlers is a long way from 'home'.\nThe rapid growth of Melbourne made the site unsuitable as a cemetery, so a new burial ground was established at what is now Queen Victoria Market. Save for two wattle trees, the graves of the first buried went unmarked until 1871. The Department of Public Works then commissioned a sandstone obelisk by Samuel Craven for this purpose, its pointed uppermost section now missing. The memorial was erected in April 1871, and at the time of its unveiling a large cross was cut into the lawns surrounding it.

He has created several commemorative sculptures, including the Australian War Memorial's Simpson and His Donkey. Winning the commission for a memorial to Edward 'Weary' Dunlop, Corlett produced a work that not only commemorated this extraordinary man but paid homage to all medical staff serving prisoners of war in Asia-Pacific during World War II. The sculpture includes metal spikes that were used in the Burma-Thailand railway.\n Weary Dunlop trained in Melbourne as a pharmacist before he turned to medicine. He then undertook surgical training in London, where he remained until the outbreak of World War II. Dunlop joined the Medical Corps of the Australian Army. A surgeon of considerable skill, he served in a senior position in the Middle East and was then transferred to Java. In 1942, his company was captured by Japanese troops and imprisoned first in Singapore and then in Changi, Thailand. His company was sent to work on the Thai segment of the infamous Burma-Thailand railway. A natural organiser and leader, Dunlop led the first Australian prisoners of war who were to work on the line. He was a courageous leader and compassionate doctor, and restored morale in those terrible prison camps and jungle hospitals. He defied his captors, gave hope to the sick and eased the anguish of the dying.\n After 1945 and with the war behind him, Dunlop turned his energies to healing and to building bridges; he worked towards the health and welfare of former prisoners of war and their families, and towards promoting better relations between Australia and Asia.\n Following Dunlop's death in 1993, funds were raised through the Weary Dunlop Statue Appeal. Peter Corlett's memorial Weary Dunlop was unveiled by Premier Jeff Kennett on 15 August 1995.","Sir Edward \"Weary\" Dunlop","https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_SCREEN/ART90407.JPG","Bronze statue with granite pedestal"  ],

He then became assistant to William Leslie Bowles, working on the King George V and Sir John Monash Memorials. Ewers is well known for his work on the John F. Kennedy Memorial.\nBorn near Wagga in 1884, Sir Thomas Blamey was the first Australian to become field marshal. He was a controversial man, who commanded much respect for his actions on the battlefield and his willingness to challenge British and US generals, but his skills did not translate well to the civilian arena. As police commissioner of Victoria between 1925 and 1936, he was harsh in his treatment of Labor activists and the unemployed, and he resigned amid scandal when he was linked to wounding the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Bureau. Still, Blamey was knighted in 1935 and promoted to field marshal in 1950, the year before he died.\nA memorial to Blamey was announced in 1958, although its site opposite the memorial to Sir John Monash had been reserved since 1952. There was some dispute over just what vehicle Blamey would be mounted on, with both tradition and Blamey's wife demanding a horse. Ewers won this battle and mounted his subject on a military Jeep. Sited opposite Monash on his stead - with whom Blamey had served in World War I - Ewers' statue captures the transformation of the technologies of war through this symbol of its mechanisation. In familiar military practice, the plaque is a roll call of Blamey's military positions.\nEwers' sculpture is one of the few pieces of traditional memorial statuary created after the 1950s. It represents a change in memorial tradition and, importantly, a decline in monumental figurative sculpture.","Sir Thomas Blamey Memorial","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Thomas_Blamey_statue_Melbourne.jpg","Bronze statue with granite pedestal"  ],

Below the bust a woman is depicted offering a wreath (representing the State of Victoria) and a young man is depicted holding a scroll (representing education).\nWilliam John Clarke was born in Tasmania in 1831 and moved to Victoria in 1860. A philanthropist and wealthy pastoralist, he gave generously to the building funds for St Paul's Cathedral and Trinity College, and supported several other causes. He was actively involved in many areas of public life and was the first Australian to be made baronet. He died in 1897, stepping from a tramcar in Collins Street.\nFollowing Clarke's death, a public meeting was held to determine how best to memorialise him. The monument, it was thought, must be 'of heroic size' and yet in keeping with Clarke's modesty. Mackennal sculpted the marble in London in consultation with Clarke's son-in-law and with the final approval of Lady Janet Clarke.","Sir William John Clarke","http://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/39/335389-small.jpg","Marble statue"  ],

Many opposed Britain's policy, and in Australia many questioned why the nation should be involved. Nevertheless, loyalty to Empire ruled and 16 000 troops were sent, almost a quarter from Victoria. The 5th Victorian Contingent was the largest of eight sent by the state. Some 228 Victorians were killed during the war, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging in May 1902.\nFollowing the return of soldiers, the remaining members of the 5th Victorian Contingent erected this monument to honour their fallen comrades. It is a secular memorial, with traditional funerary symbolism on an elaborate and Gothic scale. Four bronze plaques commemorate the soldiers and in part the text reads: 'Unveiled by members of the 5th Victorian Contingent VMR/ in memory of their fallen comrades in South Africa 1901-1902/ Honour the brave/ King and Empire/ Lest we forget/ AD 1903'. One face of the monument is oriented due west, as is common with memorials to lost soldiers.\nThe monument was originally constructed opposite the Victoria Barracks, on St Kilda Road, but was relocated in 1965.

But this scene of innocence was created in a far less naive setting.\nStanford was apprenticed to a London stonemason before coming to Australia to try his luck on the Bendigo goldfields. When he failed to make his fortune, he turned to horse stealing, and in 1854 was imprisoned for 10 years. He was released after six on ticket-of-leave, but was soon found guilty on two charges of highway robbery and another of horse stealing. The sentences amounted to a total of 22 years, two of which were served as hard labour in irons after Stanford broke out of a supposedly 'escape-proof' gaol in 1861. In Melbourne's Pentridge Prison, Stanford's talent for drawing and carving was recognised - he carved bones left over from stews - and the prison governor allowed him to turn his hand to carving stone. Local sculptor Charles Summers tutored Stanford, who soon set to carving a fountain from bluestone from the prison quarry, which was the only material available to him. He modelled the fountain's avian adornments on a stuffed eagle-hawk and modelled the boy on the governor's son.\nThe fountain was installed in Carpentaria Place (now known as Gordon Reserve) in 1871, following Stanford's release after he - and his friends petitioned for this on the grounds of his ill health. The Illustrated Australian News claimed the fountain was 'not only a work of great beauty but...executed under circumstances of extreme difficulty [which for] most men would have been insurmountable'. Stanford received no payment for the fountain but in time became a respected citizen; he established a business in Windsor, which had a reputation for creating fine headstones.\nStanford died in 1880 from 'stonemasons' disease', having inhaled a surfeit of fine dust while creating his beautiful fountain.","Stanford Fountain","http://www.weekendnotes.com/im/000/09/stanford-fountain-gordon-reserve-melbourne-water-f.jpg","Bluestone fountain"  ],

Formerly known as the Association for the Blind, this organisation has provided services and advocacy for people with blindness and vision impairment since 1895.\nTilly Aston was the first blind person in Australia to attend university, but her education was cut short by an absence of textbooks in Braille. In 1894, she established a Braille library and a year later founded the Association for the Blind, the aim of which was to improve the quality of life for the blind through self-help rather than through charity. She was responsible for gaining for the blind free post for Braille and talking books, free travel on public transport and the right to vote.\nHasell's interactive sculpture consists of three connecting bells cast in bronze, and features images of Aston. When this work is approached, movement sensors trigger a series of tolls. Fittingly, the inscription on one bell is in Braille.","Tilly Aston Bell","http://www.sounddesign.unimelb.edu.au/web/hasell/tilly1Mid.jpg","Bronze sculpture"  ],

The individual elements of Time and Tide loosely represent a tree (signifying growth, knowledge and the land), a flame (signifying rebirth and transcendence), and a shell (signifying the ocean).","Time and Tide","http://www.emelbourne.net.au/objects/images/TmeAndTide.jpg","Bluestone, white marble, bronze and stainless-steel sculpture"  ],

He studied extensively in Europe, and is a jeweller and silversmith by trade. The technique Jenkins employed on Weathervanes is repouss', the metal beaten from its underside to give shape and relief to the design, and was acquired while visiting Venice on a Palladio Foundation scholarship.\n Each of the four weathervanes takes the shape of an animal: a horse, pig, fish and bird. They are positioned high on tram poles to give aerial performances with each gust of wind. The vanes have been conceived to represent specific aspects of Melbourne: the bird symbolises the city's parks and gardens; the horse symbolises its culture and sport; the fish refers to its waterways; and the pig represents the city's hope and future - the latter a tongue-in-cheek reference to 'pigs can fly'. Jenkins said of the sculpture, 'I wanted each of these weathervanes to be cartoon-like and even frivolous. We take our cities for granted and with the daily pedestrian bustle it is always business as usual. It takes something very unusual to attract someone's eye. I want people to look up and smile!'\n The City of Melbourne commissioned Jenkins to make this work, which took him four months to complete. Lord Mayor Councillor Des Clark unveiled Weathervanes in March 1993.","Weathervanes","https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8086/8587846616_80ace68a3a_b.jpg","Hand-beaten copper sculpture with gold-leaf detail"  ],

It was removed from its original site around 1953, after which Giannarelli & Sons acquired it for their land at Merri Creek, Northcote. It was never erected at Northcote. Its composite parts were disassembled and later found around the creek with the Coburg Council. Giannarelli restored the work for temporary erection at one of main entrances, on Melbourne Avenue, to the 1988 Brisbane Expo.

He studied first in Melbourne and then in London. Following his return to Australia, Richardson produced many war memorials, as well as the famous Mercury statue for the former Age building in Collins Street.\nRichardson sculpted three memorial fountains dedicated to the Ievers family, who donated them to the community in thanks for its support. William Jnr (1881-95) William Snr (1895-1901), and George Hawkins (1901-21) consecutively represented the Smith Ward for a period of 40 years. George Ievers proposed the fountains in 1913 as part of a beautification scheme coordinated by the Parks & Gardens Committee, of which he was a member. At the unveiling of this second monument, Minister Mutchinson claimed: 'the residents of Melbourne should be grateful to the Parks & Gardens Committee for having transformed ugly, vacant spaces into beauty spots and breathing spaces for the city'.","William Ievers Junior Memorial Drinking Fountain","https://fergusonandurie.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/carlton-william-ievers-fountain-01a.jpg","Granite, marble and bluestone drinking fountain"  ],
