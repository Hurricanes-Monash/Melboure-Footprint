But this scene of innocence was created in a far less naive setting.\nStanford was apprenticed to a London stonemason before coming to Australia to try his luck on the Bendigo goldfields. When he failed to make his fortune, he turned to horse stealing, and in 1854 was imprisoned for 10 years. He was released after six on ticket-of-leave, but was soon found guilty on two charges of highway robbery and another of horse stealing. The sentences amounted to a total of 22 years, two of which were served as hard labour in irons after Stanford broke out of a supposedly 'escape-proof' gaol in 1861. In Melbourne's Pentridge Prison, Stanford's talent for drawing and carving was recognised - he carved bones left over from stews - and the prison governor allowed him to turn his hand to carving stone. Local sculptor Charles Summers tutored Stanford, who soon set to carving a fountain from bluestone from the prison quarry, which was the only material available to him. He modelled the fountain's avian adornments on a stuffed eagle-hawk and modelled the boy on the governor's son.\nThe fountain was installed in Carpentaria Place (now known as Gordon Reserve) in 1871, following Stanford's release after he - and his friends petitioned for this on the grounds of his ill health. The Illustrated Australian News claimed the fountain was 'not only a work of great beauty but...executed under circumstances of extreme difficulty [which for] most men would have been insurmountable'. Stanford received no payment for the fountain but in time became a respected citizen; he established a business in Windsor, which had a reputation for creating fine headstones.\nStanford died in 1880 from 'stonemasons' disease', having inhaled a surfeit of fine dust while creating his beautiful fountain.","Stanford Fountain","http://www.weekendnotes.com/im/000/09/stanford-fountain-gordon-reserve-melbourne-water-f.jpg","Artwork","http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AIQ29H3MW1s/UJoVKk2xVvI/AAAAAAAAM-4/_W4ZpXqpZ1I/s1600/Stanford+Fountain+03.jpg","http://www.emelbourne.net.au/objects/thumbs/tn_StanfordFountain.jpg","Caulfield"  ],

It has been conceived to engage with its environment, visually connecting to its surroundings through both form and material.\nSpronk's intention was to create a dialogue of sorts between art, history and place. His inspiration was Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem 'Ozymandias', which speaks of the fragile and transient nature of all that is human. Quoting from the poem, the pedestal reads: 'My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings. Look on my work you Mighty, and despair.'

Fittingly, the inscription on one bell is in Braille.","Tilly Aston Bell","http://www.sounddesign.unimelb.edu.au/web/hasell/tilly1Mid.jpg","Artwork","http://www.sounddesign.unimelb.edu.au/web/hasell/tilly2.jpg","http://simplyaustralia.net/images/aston/Tilly_bell.jpg","City"  ],

In 1974, he began to focus on more symbolic forms. Robinson's major commissions include four sculptures for the Australian Institute of Sport, Canberra, Gymnast for the New Olympic Museum, Lausanne, and The Pathfinder and Water Children, now with the City of Melbourne. Mining giant Conzinc Riotinto (now known as Rio Tinto) commissioned Robinson's The Pathfinder, which they planned to install in their proposed new building. When the building failed to go ahead, the 'dynamic' sculpture of the hammer thrower in action was placed on long-term loan with the City of Melbourne, which sited the bronze in the Queen Victoria Gardens. The hammer held by the figure has been stolen several times and duly returned or replaced by another. Lord Mayor Councillor Whalley unveiled The Pathfinder in April 1974.","The Pathfinder","http://ahoy.tk-jk.net/ImagesMelbourneMemorials/Mar4/PathFinder.jpg","Artwork","http://www.thatsmelbourne.com.au/PublishingImages/Places/PublicArt/Pathfinder-large.jpg","https://melbourneartcritic.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05763.jpg","City"  ],

The girl is kneeling on her hands and knees, the boy lying down, one foot in the air, one hand scooping water. While this sculpture wasn't commissioned for the site, it demonstrates a shift towards more realist statuary that engages with its environment. Like The Pathfinder, this sculpture was in fact commissioned by Conzinc Riotinto (now known as Rio Tinto). It was purchased by the City of Melbourne in 1973 as a part of its re-landscaping of the gardens.","Water Children","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5643/22923811603_f7ee200832.jpg","Artwork","","","City"  ],

Cow up a Tree is a sculpture that has been exhibited on a famous Parisian boulevard, at a world-renowned Arts festival, in a distinguished French museum and permanently in the newly developed Melbourne Docklands. To understand the background of Cow Up a Tree, read Victoria Hammond's essay below but in short, John Kelly sculpture is the conjunction of two Australian histories - Australian floods and Dobell's cows.","Cow Up A

She was a tireless community worker, who made a significant contribution to the community, particularly with regards children and young adults. Following Angela's death, her family donated funds towards a memorial artwork. In 1994, local artist Loretta Quinn was commissioned to undertake the work, which would commemorate Angela's contribution to the community, as well as those of all childcare workers.\nWithin Three Worlds comprises a bronze figure of a young girl looking towards three boat-like vessels from the edge of a pond. The figure represents Anna as a child, but is an 'every child' that embodies the innocence of youth and possibilities of the future. More gestural than literal, the vessels, with their highly decorative surfaces, symbolise the passage from this world to the next.","Within Three Worlds","https://melbourneartcritic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dsc06016.jpg","Artwork","https://melbourneartcritic.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/within-three-worlds-1.jpg","","City"  ],

He is a life-size, dingo-like dog who surveys the activity in City Square. Larry was based loosely on Irving's dog Lucy and on her uncle, Larry. She claims that the dog is iconic to Australia, and from the moment it was unveiled, Larry La Trobe became one of Melbourne's most loved sculptures.\nDespite being anchored to the site with 30 centimetre bolts, Larry disappeared in August 1995. Council immediately launched a campaign for his return, but to no avail. On hearing of the theft, Larry's most ardent admirer, Peter Kolliner, who had owned the foundry where he was cast, offered to produce another one. Irving altered the new Larry's colouring to affect some individuality (he has a redder tinge) but in all other respects he is the same.\nLarry was officially welcomed home on 16 September 1996. Melbourne band Jugularity entertained the crowd with an ode to the sculpture, Larry Come Home, a dogumentary, sung to the tune of Advance Australia Fair.","Larry LaTrobe","http://www.weekendnotes.com/images/larry-latrobe.jpg","Artwork","http://pamelairving.com.au/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Larry-Home.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Irving_Bronze_Sculpture_Larry_La_Trobe_1992_1996_a.jpg/300px-Irving_Bronze_Sculpture_Larry_La_Trobe_1992_1996_a.jpg","City"  ],

This was an attempt to appease a dissatisfied and vocal public, which had criticised council for the poor state of the pieces located in Fitzroy Gardens.\nPaul Montford's Water Nymph is one of the works that were purchased. It is a bronze statue of a young woman, with raised arms stroking her hair. She kneels on a round base, which is set in an ornamental lake. This is a classic image of the period. The nymph is linked to age-old representations of the mermaid and the siren, which symbolise female sexuality.

Bass gained inspiration for his work from his extensive travels, which is apparent in The Genie. One of Australia's leading sculptors, Bass has created some of the country's most significant works, such as the entrance sculpture at Canberra's National Library, Trial of Socrates at Wilson Hall, University of Melbourne, and Ethos in Canberra's Civic Square.\nIn 1971, sculptor Peter Corlett presented the concept of a children's play sculpture to Melbourne City Council. The commission for this sculpture went to Bass. The Genie's design is a synthesis of Western and Eastern art forms, and combines the characteristics of an Egyptian cat with a lion. It was designed to complement its natural surroundings, while still being able to attract the attention of children. Its form and textured surface are intended to encourage play and to extend children's experience of art by inviting direct physical contact. In part, its inscription reads: 'The Genie/ A fantasy play sculpture/ for children'.","The Genie","http://photos.travellerspoint.com/721016/The_Genie.jpg","Artwork","http://photos.travellerspoint.com/721016/The_Genie.jpg","https://photos.travelblog.org/Photos/229485/829758/f/7918285-10-The-Genie-Sculpture-in-Alexandra-Gardens-Melbourne-0.jpg","City"  ],

There is a sense of 'folk religion' in much of her art, and whether the symbols derive from the mystery of a Latin mass or the animist universe, a Celtic myth or a Japanese garden, she says they are 'visual references to which others will relate'.\nA patented bronze sculpture, Beyond the Ocean of Existence comprises a single large ball surrounded by eight bronze coils. A series of smaller balls and lengths of column, both triangular and circular in cross-section, surmount these coils. At the sculpture's top is a stylised angel. The work is a mounted on a granite plinth of dressed and polished blocks.","Beyond the Ocean of Existence","http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_X5BQbecGrps/TIqPpKuRbGI/AAAAAAABbho/Ru03RO0z13I/s1600/DSCN8508.JPG","Artwork","https://melbourneartcritic.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05772.jpg","https://melbourneartcritic.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dsc05770.jpg","City"  ],

His best-known work is a statue of the famed Scottish poet Robert Burns, which stands at Ayr, in Scotland. A replica of this statue was cast in London for the City of Melbourne, and was erected in 1904 under the auspices of the Caledonian Society. Lawson's Burns is an imposing, larger than life-size figure depicted in tails and breeches, his posture and countenance suggesting a powerful spirit. Lawson's sculpture of Burns cost around '1000, and it is said that nearly every Scot in Melbourne contributed. The memorial symbolises the contribution Scottish migrants made to the early development of Victoria, with many of the first graziers and squatters in Gippsland and the Western District being of Scottish descent. The memorial remains a uniting symbol for Melbourne's Scottish community. It was originally located on the west side of St Kilda Road, where Sir John Madden, the lieutenant governor, unveiled it on 23 January 1904.

The eldest son of Queen Victoria, Edward was rebellious into his adulthood and the Queen showed her displeasure by denying him any governmental position. Despite his lack of experience, Edward successfully negotiated England's conciliation with France, earning him the title of 'the peacemaker', and his social reforms made him popular among his subjects.\nThe desire to create a monument to Edward in Melbourne took hold immediately following his death in 1910. Mackennal was commissioned to undertake the work on a tender of '1867, but the statue eventually cost three times that price. The outbreak of World War I delayed the statue's production, but casting in London commenced at the war's end.

He has created several commemorative sculptures, including the Australian War Memorial's Simpson and His Donkey. Winning the commission for a memorial to Edward 'Weary' Dunlop, Corlett produced a work that not only commemorated this extraordinary man but paid homage to all medical staff serving prisoners of war in Asia-Pacific during World War II. The sculpture includes metal spikes that were used in the Burma-Thailand railway.\n Weary Dunlop trained in Melbourne as a pharmacist before he turned to medicine. He then undertook surgical training in London, where he remained until the outbreak of World War II. Dunlop joined the Medical Corps of the Australian Army. A surgeon of considerable skill, he served in a senior position in the Middle East and was then transferred to Java. In 1942, his company was captured by Japanese troops and imprisoned first in Singapore and then in Changi, Thailand. His company was sent to work on the Thai segment of the infamous Burma-Thailand railway. A natural organiser and leader, Dunlop led the first Australian prisoners of war who were to work on the line. He was a courageous leader and compassionate doctor, and restored morale in those terrible prison camps and jungle hospitals. He defied his captors, gave hope to the sick and eased the anguish of the dying.\n After 1945 and with the war behind him, Dunlop turned his energies to healing and to building bridges; he worked towards the health and welfare of former prisoners of war and their families, and towards promoting better relations between Australia and Asia.\n Following Dunlop's death in 1993, funds were raised through the Weary Dunlop Statue Appeal.

He then became assistant to William Leslie Bowles, working on the King George V and Sir John Monash Memorials. Ewers is well known for his work on the John F. Kennedy Memorial.\nBorn near Wagga in 1884, Sir Thomas Blamey was the first Australian to become field marshal. He was a controversial man, who commanded much respect for his actions on the battlefield and his willingness to challenge British and US generals, but his skills did not translate well to the civilian arena. As police commissioner of Victoria between 1925 and 1936, he was harsh in his treatment of Labor activists and the unemployed, and he resigned amid scandal when he was linked to wounding the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Bureau. Still, Blamey was knighted in 1935 and promoted to field marshal in 1950, the year before he died.\nA memorial to Blamey was announced in 1958, although its site opposite the memorial to Sir John Monash had been reserved since 1952. There was some dispute over just what vehicle Blamey would be mounted on, with both tradition and Blamey's wife demanding a horse. Ewers won this battle and mounted his subject on a military Jeep. Sited opposite Monash on his stead - with whom Blamey had served in World War I - Ewers' statue captures the transformation of the technologies of war through this symbol of its mechanisation. In familiar military practice, the plaque is a roll call of Blamey's military positions.\nEwers' sculpture is one of the few pieces of traditional memorial statuary created after the 1950s. It represents a change in memorial tradition and, importantly, a decline in monumental figurative sculpture.","Sir Thomas Blamey Memorial","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Thomas_Blamey_statue_Melbourne.jpg","Artwork","https://melbourneartcritic.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc07199.jpg","https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/5a/e3/8e/5ae38e0f1babe40f3f4d83b7d3afbc3f.jpg","City"  ],

Designed by Walter MacFarlane and cast by his prominent Glaswegian Saracen Foundry, it has an imposing circular canopy richly decorated with cast-iron lacework.\nThe fountain was originally sited in the roadway at the intersection of Errol and Queensberry Streets, but was moved in 1889 to allow for the construction of the new cable-tram tracks. In 1917, it was moved to the footpath, but without its bluestone steps and iron railings. In 1972, a vehicle collided with the fountain, damaging its wonderful canopy. Consequently, the following year it was moved to its current and safer location outside the Town Hall. Prior to the mid-1960s, the fountain's drinking spout was replaced with a modern Danks 'bubbler', but in 2001 a duplicate of the original was created - including the small figure of a kangaroo - based on MacFarlane's original drawings and on moulds from similar fountains.\nThomas Henderson, the great-grandson of the donor, attended the ceremony for the fountain's restoration.","Henderson Drinking Fountain","https://melbourneartcritic.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/henderson-memorial-drinking-fountain-north-melbourne.jpg","Artwork","https://bagnidilucca.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/img_5026.jpg","https://bagnidilucca.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/img_5025.jpg","City"  ],

Manufactured by Garnkirk, its simple design comprises three tazza bowls of diminishing size set on a volcanic-rock outcrop within a pool.\nIts construction commenced in 1863 under the direction of Clement Hodgkinson, the assistant commissioner of the Survey Office. The original concept incorporated a pool 100 feet (30.5 metres) long, with a central cluster of rocks from which water was to be ejected to nearly 50 feet (15.25 metres), though this appears not to have been realised. The pond was filled with small islands of aquatic plantings and Sydney couch grass.\nIn 1968, Melbourne City Council wanted to replace the fountain with an elaborate sundial to commemorate the recently deceased Prime Minister Harold Holt. When the council's intention became known, some 800 people petitioned against the fountain's removal.

He studied extensively in Europe, and is a jeweller and silversmith by trade.

They are positioned high on tram poles to give aerial performances with each gust of wind. The vanes have been conceived to represent specific aspects of Melbourne: the bird symbolises the city's parks and gardens; the horse symbolises its culture and sport; the fish refers to its waterways; and the pig represents the city's hope and future - the latter a tongue-in-cheek reference to 'pigs can fly'. Jenkins said of the sculpture, 'I wanted each of these weathervanes to be cartoon-like and even frivolous. We take our cities for granted and with the daily pedestrian bustle it is always business as usual. It takes something very unusual to attract someone's eye. I want people to look up and smile!'\n The City of Melbourne commissioned Jenkins to make this work, which took him four months to complete.

In heroic style, the general stands over a shattered cannon, presumably to symbolise his ultimate triumph over the trials and tribulations of military victory and defeat. Four bronze bas-reliefs feature on the limestone base, each depicting one of four key stages in Gordon's life: his victories in China, his charitable activities in Gravesend, his governorship in Sudan and his death in Khartoum. In part, the inscription reads: 'I have tried to do my duty/ This is the happy warrior - this is he that every man in arms should wish to be'.\nGordon, the 'Great Christian General', was one of the most popular Englishmen of his day, and his reputation was forged on the battlefield and through his Christian activities at Gravesend. During his appointment as secretary to the viceroy of India in 1880, Gordon became unpopular with the government of the day for passionately campaigning for native rule in countries such as Botswana, South Africa and Ireland. Gordon met his death 1885 when, as governor-general of the Sudan, he refused to evacuate Egyptian forces from Khartoum, believing this to be unsafe.","General Charles Gordon Memorial","http://www.emelbourne.net.au/objects/thumbs/tn_GeneralCharlesGordon.jpg","Artwork","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Charles_George_Gordon_Statue_Melbourne.jpg","http://c8.alamy.com/comp/CBF8MA/statue-of-major-general-charles-george-gordon-in-spring-street-melbourne-CBF8MA.jpg","City"  ],

In the early 1900s, she studied sculpture with Edouard Lanteri at the Royal College of Art, London. On her return to Australia, she quickly became the country's most acclaimed woman sculptor, undertaking a number of important commissions.\n One such piece is her marble bust of the English nurse Edith Cavell. This work commemorates a woman whose beneficence delivered her a tragic end, which is depicted on the cast-bronze relief panels on the bust's pedestal.\n Edith Cavell trained as nurse in the late 1890s. In 1907, she was posted in Brussels to assist in establishing a modern nursing system at the Berkendael Medical Institute. At the outbreak of World War I she was left in charge of the hospital and what is now known as the Red Cross. During that time she assisted more than 200 Belgian, British and French soldiers who had been separated from their armies, or who had escaped German detention. In 1915, she was accused of conspiring to help prisoners escape, and was tried by a military court in Brussels. She was convicted and sentenced to death, along with four others. Cavell was executed by firing squad on 12 October 1915; she was still wearing her nurse's uniform. Her last words feature on one of the memorial's plaques: 'I know now that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred and no bitterness towards anyone.' Cavell's body was returned to England in 1919, where a full military service was conducted at Westminster Abbey.\n The appeal for funds for a Cavell memorial garnered such support in Australia that much of the money was devoted to assisting incapacitated war nurses. In 1916, the Edith Cavell Trust Fund was officially inaugurated in Victoria; it lasted nearly 60 years, until 1974.","Nurse Edith Cavell","http://www.whitehat.com.au/images/People/Cavell.jpg","Artwork","https://www.flickr.com/photos/culturaldevelopmentandengagement/3741716956/","http://anzac.unimelb.edu.au/images/nurse_edith_cavell-12801b06.jpg","City"  ],

A philanthropist and wealthy pastoralist, he gave generously to the building funds for St Paul's Cathedral and Trinity College, and supported several other causes. He was actively involved in many areas of public life and was the first Australian to be made baronet. He died in 1897, stepping from a tramcar in Collins Street.\nFollowing Clarke's death, a public meeting was held to determine how best to memorialise him.

Many opposed Britain's policy, and in Australia many questioned why the nation should be involved. Nevertheless, loyalty to Empire ruled and 16 000 troops were sent, almost a quarter from Victoria. The 5th Victorian Contingent was the largest of eight sent by the state. Some 228 Victorians were killed during the war, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging in May 1902.\nFollowing the return of soldiers, the remaining members of the 5th Victorian Contingent erected this monument to honour their fallen comrades. It is a secular memorial, with traditional funerary symbolism on an elaborate and Gothic scale. Four bronze plaques commemorate the soldiers and in part the text reads: 'Unveiled by members of the 5th Victorian Contingent VMR/ in memory of their fallen comrades in South Africa 1901-1902/ Honour the brave/ King and Empire/ Lest we forget/ AD 1903'. One face of the monument is oriented due west, as is common with memorials to lost soldiers.\nThe monument was originally constructed opposite the Victoria Barracks, on St Kilda Road, but was relocated in 1965. In 1911, it was decided that a memorial would be erected to all Australians who perished during the war; the Boer War Memorial is located nearby and now administered by the City of Port Phillip.","South African War Memorial","http://www.emelbourne.net.au/objects/images/SouthAfricanWar01.jpg","Artwork","https://melbourneartcritic.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/boar-war-memorial.jpg","http://canopuscomputing.com.au/gallery2/d/9433-3/e-510_jak_2010-_3136264_Ew.jpg","City"  ],

It was a place of hope and a place of sorrow. Early colonists could sight incoming ships from this high point, which brought tangible links with the old country; and known as Burial Hill, it was also the city's first burial ground. This latter role is reflected well in the Gothic architecture of the memorial, for as if wrested from an English church it is a reminder that this final resting place for an estimated six early settlers is a long way from 'home'.\nThe rapid growth of Melbourne made the site unsuitable as a cemetery, so a new burial ground was established at what is now Queen Victoria Market. Save for two wattle trees, the graves of the first buried went unmarked until 1871. The Department of Public Works then commissioned a sandstone obelisk by Samuel Craven for this purpose, its pointed uppermost section now missing. The memorial was erected in April 1871, and at the time of its unveiling a large cross was cut into the lawns surrounding it. Its inscription reads: 'Erected in 1871/ to the memory of/ some of the earliest of the pioneers of this colony/ whose remains were interred near this spot'.","Pioneer Monument","http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1636/24630612522_4f73a03c46.jpg","Artwork","http://www.portphillippioneersgroup.org.au/images/flag_pio.jpg","http://www.emelbourne.net.au/objects/thumbs/tn_PioneerMonument01.jpg","City"  ],

Each pillar is inscribed with a commodity that John Batman lists in his diary as an item he traded with Wurundjeri elders in 1835 to secure 600 000 acres of their land around Port Phillip Bay: 'blankets', 'knives', 'looking glasses', 'tomahawks', 'beads', 'scissors' and 'flour'. Knowles' soundscape accompanies this compelling work, with Batman's entry on the controversial exchange read out in Woiwurrung-the local Indigenous language-and several other languages representing the ethnic groups present in Australia around the time of settlement. The etched pillars are a powerful symbol; tombstone-like, they speak the fate of many Indigenous people through the process of settlement and colonisation. Placed near the entrance to Melbourne Museum, this sculpture also speaks eloquently of the relationship this institution once had with Indigenous peoples, collecting often-sacred items and relics, and at times by inappropriate means. In relation to the historical and political nature of this work, Fiona Foley has stated, 'As the history has been written by the victors, it is only now that the silent histories of the indigenous populations are given a voice'.\nLie of the Land was commissioned by the City of Melbourne to coincide with the Australian Reconciliation Convention, held in Melbourne in May 1997, and the 30th anniversary of the 1967 referendum, which gave Indigenous Australians the right to vote.

Natural falls in the river created a barrier between the salt- and freshwater, and just below the falls a natural widening in the river enabled boats to turn around after unloading at Customs House (now the Immigration Museum).\n In 1996, the Yarra Turning Basin Project was launched. This would recreate the historic turning basin, which had since been filled in, and develop a new riverside promenade that would complement and extend the existing spatial design of the river's northern bank. The concept for the site's public artwork entailed a series of five figureheads, which would sit on wooden piers that were integral to the design and material of the timber wharf.\n Council's Public Art & Acquisitions Committee selected Bruce Armstrong and Geoffrey Bartlett's design from a short-list of four. Both Armstrong and Bartlett are renowned Melbourne sculptors, each having undertaken many public commissions and having exhibited widely. With the working title '5 figureheads', they crafted Constellation from wood and metal, and using traditional and contemporary approaches to the sculpture's design. The five carved-wood figureheads comprise a dragon, woman, bird, man and lion. These evoke a long history of figurehead carving from around the world and also reflect the ethnic and cultural diversity of those who used the turning basin during the early years of settlement. The constructed metal elements suggest maritime forms, lines and images but they are never simply literal; they require the viewer to engage with the work to read their reference point. The title of this work, too, pays homage to the long history of seafaring, the stars having guided many a vessel from one port to another.\n Constellation was unveiled in 1997.","Constellation","http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/33707753.jpg","Artwork","https://melbourneartcritic.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/barlett-armstong-constellation-eagle.jpg","http://www.thatsmelbourne.com.au/PublishingImages/Places/PublicArt/Constellation-large.jpg","City"  ],

He undertook further studies in sculpture and printmaking at RMIT.\nGinger's non-figurative The Echo takes its inspiration from Melbourne's rich and diverse cultures, particularly its Asian cultures. Both the design and vibrant sienna colouring of the work have strong associations with Eastern spirituality. The Echo is sited close to and Chinatown and what was, at the time of installation, the Bank of Hong Kong, with the intention of connecting the work to its cultural environment. The design also seeks to integrate disparate aspects; Ginger has incorporated seating to encourage passers-by to linger and interact with the sculpture, and to see it as part of the streetscape rather than as an interloper from the lofty world of art.\nThe Echo was commissioned in 1992 as part of the Swanston Walk Public Art Project, but its fabrication and installation were delayed due to a lack of sponsorship.

She completed a Master of Fine Arts at RMIT, where her research led her to explore repeated forms and the rhythms they create. These concerns are apparent in Island Wave, her first major public sculpture in Melbourne.\nIsland Wave is a large work that comprises a repeated motif and which follows the gentle curve of the Franklin and Queen Streets roundabout. Young's motif is a French curve, to which she was drawn for its sensuality and its past use as a mechanical drawing aid for the technical works executed by engineers and architects. The repetition of this motif along the curve of the roundabout creates a sense of movement, particularly for the motorist travelling alongside it. It is scaled to give one the sensation of both moving in rhythm to and being engulfed by a wave. Unlike a solid monolithic sculpture, there is a certain 'lightness' about Island Wave, which is achieved by its thinness, its open form and the sense of movement it evokes. Island Wave engages both the motorist and pedestrian, and its prominent location near Queen Victoria Market ensures that it has a local and international audience.\nThis elegant sculpture was created as the inaugural work for the council's Melbourne Collection Commissions, a fund for significant and permanent site-specific works by contemporary artists. It was fabricated by Gilbro Engineering and installed by Famous Constructions. Controversially, the sculpture replaced Tom Bill's With and With Each Other, which, despite having only a three-month permit, had remained on the roundabout since the 1998 Construction in Process Sculpture Festival. Island Wave was launched by Lord Mayor John So and Councillor Kimberly Kitching in October 2003.","Island Wave","http://www.emelbourne.net.au/objects/images/IslandWave02.jpg","Artwork","http://lisayoung.net.au/images/publicart/3.Island-Wave-A.jpg","http://www.emelbourne.net.au/objects/thumbs/tn_IslandWave02.jpg","City"  ],

It is a point of conjecture among historians whether James Cook, the famous navigator, ever lived in the house, but almost certainly he visited his parents at the house.\nIn 1933 the owner of the cottage decided to sell it with a condition of sale that the building remain in England. She was persuaded to change \"England\" to \"the Empire\", and accepted an Australian bid of ?800, by Russell Grimwade, as opposed to the highest local offer of ?300.\nThe cottage was deconstructed brick by brick and packed into 253 cases and 40 barrels for shipping on board the Port Dunedin from Hull. Cuttings from ivy that adorned the house were also taken and planted when the house was re-erected in Melbourne. Grimwade, a notable businessman and philanthropist, donated the house to the people of Victoria for the centenary anniversary of the settlement of Melbourne in October 1934.\nThe cottage immediately became a popular tourist attraction. In 1978 further restoration work was carried out on the cottage. An English cottage garden has been established around the house, further adding to its period reconstruction. Very few of the items in the house are from the Cook family, but all are representative furnishings of the period.","Cooks' Cottage","http://www.thatsmelbourne.com.au/Placestogo/CooksCottage/PublishingImages/cooks-cottage-main-page.jpg","Gallery/Museum","http://www.weekendnotes.com/im/006/03/cooks-cottage-english-england-history-melbourne-fi1.jpg","http://www.melbourneplaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Cooks-House-front.jpg","City"  ],

As that early pioneer builder?s identity remains unverified, the museum was named after long standing residents, William and Elizabeth Box, who lived in the little cottage from 1865 to 1914 and raised ten children. As many as possible, of the original cottage?s items, were incorporated into the reproduction cottage. One such example is that the original 1840s convict bricks have been re-used to build the fireplace in the museum. The cottage museum also houses an interesting, eclectic collection of historical artifacts and photos, that have been generously donated over the last fifty years by local residents.\n\nThe ?Box Cottage? site also boasts a barn area. Items on display include an historic dray, a sample of the original tram way plates that were in use in Centre Road, Nepean Highway, and South Road from the late 1800s, different types of ploughs, market garden equipment, and much, much more.","Box Cottage Museum","http://home.vicnet.net.au/~cmhsbcm/images/Picture1.jpg","Gallery/Museum","http://home.vicnet.net.au/~cmhsbcm/images/Picture2.jpg","http://home.vicnet.net.au/~cmhsbcm/images/Picture3.jpg","Ormond"  ],

William Miller predicted on the basis of Daniel  and the \"day-year principle\" that Jesus Christ would return to Earth between the spring of 1843 and the spring of 1844. In the summer of 1844, Millerites came to believe that Jesus would return on October 22, 1844, understood to be the biblical Day of Atonement for that year. When this did not happen (an event known as the \"Great Disappointment\"), most of his followers disbanded and returned to their original churches.  Some Millerites came to believe that Miller's calculations were correct but that his interpretation of Daniel 8:14 was flawed as he assumed it was the \"earth that was to be cleansed\" or Christ would come to cleanse the world. These Adventists arrived at the conviction that Daniel 8:14 foretold Christ's entrance into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary rather than his Second Coming. This new awareness of a sanctuary in heaven became an important part of their thinking. Over the next few decades this understanding developed into the doctrine of the investigative judgment, an eschatological process commenced in 1844 in which Christians will be judged to verify their eligibility for salvation and God's justice will be confirmed before the universe. This group of Adventists continued to believe that Christ's Second Coming would be imminent. They resisted setting further dates for the event, citing Revelation 10:6, \"that there should be time no longer.\"","Glen Huntly Seventh-Day Adventist Church","https://victoriancollections.net.au/media/collectors/4f729f7b97f83e03086018a9/items/5363016a9821f40c64c6ce94/5363016a9821f40c64c6ce95/VictorianCollections-large.jpg","HeritageBuilding","","","Glen Huntly"  ],

He was succeeded by Revd Samuel Premarajah who served from 1995 until 2006. Worship is held thrice a month in the evenings in both Tamil and English. Most of the worshippers are members of their local denominational congregations. Belonging to TCCV and participating in TCCV's activities doesn't compromise their allegiance to their local churches.  Embracing the Tamil language and Tamil culture and expressing them in worship and in other activities is an objective that has been enthusiastically maintained.","Tamil Christian Congregation Victoria","http://www.melbournetamilchurch.com/assets/components/gallery/connector.php?action=web/phpthumb&w=500&h=500&zc=0&far=&q=90&src=%2Fassets%2Fgallery%2F6%2F79.jpg","HeritageBuilding","http://www.melbournetamilchurch.com/assets/components/gallery/connector.php?action=web/phpthumb&w=500&h=500&zc=0&far=&q=90&src=%2Fassets%2Fgallery%2F9%2F93.jpg","http://www.melbournetamilchurch.com/images/slider/slide2.jpg","Malvern East"  ],

After the death and resurrection of Jesus, the apostles assumed the responsibility for the community. Now, if the Church was to continue the work of Christ until His return in glory, then this mission, that Christ had given to His apostles would have to continue since such ministry was essential for the very integrity and identity of the life of the Church. The early Church constantly emphasised the importance of the Church's continuity with its apostolic origins. And so elders or leaders were appointed for the task of continuing and teaching the apostolic faith. In this paper we will analyse briefly this means employed by the early Church to assure the correct promulgation of the apostolic faith and its protection from any error.","ST Catherine Greek Orthodox Church","http://www.saintcatherine.org.au/general/images/StCatherine_Church","HeritageBuilding","http://www.churchhistories.net.au/files/cache/62ce26a018ecc4972bf051a02b40389d.jpg","http://neoskosmos.com/news/sites/default/files/imagecache/news_node_image/St-Catherines_456207390.jpg","Malvern East"  ],

It was commissioned by Fr Patrick Geoghegan, the first Catholic priest in the Port Phillip District of New South Wales, which became the separate state of Victoria in 1851. The first mass was held in the completed nave on 22 May 1842 and the completed church blessed on 23 October 1845, though the elegant cedar ceiling was not installed until 1850.

It was designed by the distinguished English architect William Butterfield, who was noted for his ecclesiastical architectural works. The foundation stone was laid in 1880. Butterfield never saw the site and the building work was frequently delayed by disputes between Butterfield, who was in England, and the church authorities in Melbourne. Butterfield resigned in 1884 and the building was completed by a local architect, Joseph Reed. Consequently, the design of the spires differs greatly from those originally planned (similar to those built at Christ Church, South Yarra). The cathedral chapter retains a scale model of the original completed design.\n\nThe cathedral was consecrated on 22 January 1891, but the spires designed by John Barr of Sydney were only finished in 1931. Its pipe organ was commissioned from the English builder T. C. Lewis, one of the most prominent organ builders of the 19th century.[2] Besides Sunday and weekday Eucharists the cathedral \"maintains the English tradition\" (p. 14) of a daily choral Evensong, being the only Australian Anglican cathedral to do so.[3]\n\nSt Paul's is unusual among Melbourne's more notable 19th-century public buildings in that it is not made from bluestone, the city's dominant building material. Instead it is made from sandstone from the Barrabool Hills and limestone embellishments of Waurn Ponds limestone, both from near Geelong, giving the cathedral a warm yellow-brown colouring rather than Melbourne's characteristic cold blue-grey. This gives it a different appearance to the bluestone Gothic of St Patrick's Roman Catholic cathedral on the eastern side of the city. Because the spires are built from Sydney sandstone and are 40 years newer, they are of a darker texture than the older parts of the building. St Paul's Moorhouse Tower is the second highest Anglican spire in the world, the tallest being that of Salisbury Cathedral.[4]\n\nBy the 1990s the constant traffic vibration in central Melbourne led to concerns about the structural soundness of the cathedral, particularly its spires. A public appeal, led by the then Dean of Melbourne, David Richardson, raised A$18 million to restore the spires and improve the interior of the building. The seven-year restoration project was completed in 2009, under the guidance of Falkinger Andronas Architects and Heritage Consultants (now Andronas Conservation Architecture). The restoration works were undertaken by Cathedral Stone and were acknowledged by the Australian Institute of Architects, the Victorian Chapter Heritage Architecture Award 2009 and the Lachlan Macquarie National Award for Heritage Architecture 2009.\n\nAs part of the work, stone heads of the former dean David Richardson and the philanthropist Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, created by Melbourne sculptor Smiley Williams and carved by stonemason Daryl Gilbert, were added to the spires and new dalle de verre glass was created by Janusz and Magda Kuszbicki for the west doors and the \"Eighth Day\" lantern in the Moorhouse Tower.","St Pauls Cathedral","https://www.stpauls.co.uk/SM4/Mutable/Uploads/generic_image/DP073155_8231538.jpg","HeritageBuilding","http://cdn.londonandpartners.com/asset/c1aaa92ffb608f266471f55d5f134111.jpg","http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/56d81409dd0895610b8b469d-1190-625/take-a-free-virtual-tour-of-st-pauls-cathedral-with-new-street-view-footage.jpg","City"  ],
